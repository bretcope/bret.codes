I'm Bret Copeland and I work at [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com) (you may know it as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)) as a software developer. I serve as team lead on our Ad Server team ([which we're hiring for](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/62162/ad-server-technology-developer-stack-exchange)).

* I'm a developer, so I love open source and writing code.
* I'm a pilot, so I love airplanes and flying.
* I'm a musician, so I love singers and songwriters.
* I'm too busy to write about most things I would like to write about.

I also have a [non-technical blog](http://bretcope.blogspot.com/) which almost never gets updated.
