So, I wrote this DSL for scheduled tasks...

## Why?

Let's say I've written a function to rebuild an index `RebuildIndex()`, and it's pretty much the best thing any programmer has ever written. Now I just need it to run every hour, and I'll finally get that promotion to Supreme Leader I've been deserving. Running once an hour is easy enough without any special tools, right? I'm working in C#, so I'll just create a new [Timer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ah1h85ch(v=vs.110).aspx).

{% highlight csharp %}
var oneHour = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
var timer = new System.Threading.Timer(RebuildIndex, null, oneHour, oneHour);
{% endhighlight %}

Done. It's perfect, and I'm the greatest.

I go into my boss's office to demand my promotion, but he takes one look at my commit and reminds me of two facts: 1. "Supreme Leader" is not an available job title, and 2. while it's true that new data is trickling in all the time, we tend to get a lot of new data near the top of every hour. We'd prefer to have the reindex always run 5 minutes past the top of every hour. Fine, I can do that with a little extra code.

{% highlight csharp %}
// get how long until five minutes after the hour
var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
var fiveAfter = new DateTime(now.Year, now.Month, now.Day, now.Hour, 5, 0, 
                                                             DateTimeKind.Utc);
var diff = fiveAfter - now;
if (diff < TimeSpan.Zero)
{
    fiveAfter = fiveAfter.AddHours(1);
    diff = fiveAfter - now;
}

// setup timer
var oneHour = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
var timer = new System.Threading.Timer(RebuildIndex, null, diff, oneHour);
{% endhighlight %}

Once again, the code is perfect. Ship it.

Hmmm, what happens if I'm doing a restart at the five minute mark? Sure it will just run again in an hour, but I'd prefer it to run as soon as the restart finishes in that scenario. Also, what happens when I add multiple servers for redundancy, but only want the task to run on one of them? What happens when I decide I want different schedules for different hours of the day, or different days of the week?

This is going to start getting rather complicated if I code all of this up manually. And sure, I'm a great programmer, but I'm also really lazy. So...

## Let's Use Schyntax Instead

Here's my new code for running the task every hour at five minutes past the hour:

{% highlight csharp %}
var schtick = new Schtick();
schtick.AddTask("minute(5)", (task, time) => RebuildIndex());
{% endhighlight %}

Schtick also supports async task callbacks.

{% highlight csharp %}
var schtick = new Schtick();
schtick.AddAsyncTask("minute(5)", async (task, time) => await DoSomethingAsync());
{% endhighlight %}

> Terminology-wise, "Schyntax" is the DSL (domain-specific language), and "Schtick" is the scheduled task runner.

There are lots of DSL's for schedules. The most prominent might be [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (for \*nix scheduled tasks), but there's also [RRULE](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html) (for iCalendar events) and many others. Cron isn't exactly what I'd call human-friendly. Can you tell me what `10 8,20 * 8 1-5` means if you don't use Cron often? Some DSL's go in the opposite direction and are wildly verbose, or will sacrifice expressiveness for simplicity.

### Schyntax Syntax

By contrast, Schyntax explicitly tries to be powerful, easy to remember, and terse, but human readable. To a programmer, the syntax should feel immediately familiar and intuitive. As we saw earlier, `minute(5)` means to run on the fifth minute of every hour. `minute(*)` means to run every minute. `minute(2,8,52)` would run on the second, eighth, and fifty-second minutes.

#### Ranges

Want to define a range? Borrowing from modern programming languages, `minute(5..8)` would run every minute between the fifth and eighth minutes, inclusive (5,6,7,8). `minute(5..<8)` is the same range, except it excludes the end value (5,6,7).

#### Intervals

What if you want to run every fifth minute? As a programmer, if you wanted to run a command on every fifth iteration of a loop, you might use the modulus operator (typically `%`).

{% highlight csharp %}
for (var i = 0; i < 50000; i++)
{
    // code
    
    if (i % 5 == 0)
    {
        // code to run on every fifth iteration
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Schyntax captures the spirit of that by using `minute(* % 5)` to indicate "run every five minutes." Or, you could use `minute(10..22 % 3)` to run every third minute starting at the tenth, and ending at the twenty-second (effectively the same as `minute(10,13,16,19,22)`).

#### Exclusions

The logical negation operator is `!` in many programming languages. So if you want to say, "run every minute except the third," you could write `minute(!3)`. To run every five minutes except the fifteenth, use `minute(*%5, !15)`. You can exclude any value, range, or interval. Exclusions always take precedence, so be careful not to exclude too much.

#### Expressions

Of course, schyntax can express more than just minutes. It has expressions for seconds, minutes, hours, days of week, days of month, and specific dates ([see docs](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax#expressions) for complete documentation), and you can use as many as you need to define your schedule.

> One of the goals is to be easy to remember. To that end, Schyntax is whitespace-insensitive and case-insensitive. You don't even have to worry about remembering whether it's `minute()` or `minutes()`. They both work. In fact `m`, `min`, `minuteOfHour`, and `minutesOfHour` are all valid. All of the Schyntax expressions have a similar set of aliases which can be found in the [expressions documentation](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax#expressions).

### Examples

Let's cover a few more examples before we get back to our original hypothetical scenario.

* Every hour from 0900 UTC until, and including, 1700 UTC (__all dates and times are UTC in Schyntax__):

        hours(9..17)

* Every five minutes from 0900 until, but not including, 1700 (notice the half-open range operator `..<` instead of `..`):
  
        hours(9 ..< 17) min(*%5)

* Same as the previous schedule, except only on Monday through Friday (inclusive):

        days(mon..fri) hours(9 ..< 17) min(*%5)

* Same as previous, except it won't run any time during the noon hour (UTC):

        days(mon..fri) hours(9..<17, !12) min(*%5)

* Noon UTC every Monday through Friday, except on Christmas:

        days(mon..fri) hour(12) date(!12/25)

* Noon UTC on the first and last days of the month:

        daysofmonth(1, -1) hour(12)

* Every minute between 2300 and 0100 UTC (ranges which wrap around are okay):

        hours(23..<1) min(*)

* Here's the Schyntax version of the Cron schedule example I gave earlier (`10 8,20 * 8 1-5`). See if this feels more readable to you:

        minute(10), hours(8,20) days(mon..fri) dates(8/1..8/31)

#### Groups

What if you want to run every five minutes during the week, and every half hour on weekends? You can do that by grouping expressions inside curly braces:

        { days(mon..fri) min(*%5) } { days(sat..sun) min(*%30) }

You could break the groups up into multiple lines if you wanted. Remember, Schyntax is whitespace-insensitive.

Got it? Great. [Full syntax documentation is available on Github](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax) if you need it.

Now let's get back to my earlier quest for promotion. I solved my need to run on a specific schedule, but I still have a problem if we're restarting or redeploying when it's supposed to run, or if we add multiple servers. Luckily, there is a library already built to solve these exact problems, assuming you run [Redis](http://redis.io/) in your data center, like any sane tech company.

## Schyntax.RedisLock

If we only want the task run on a single server, then we can use:

{% highlight csharp %}
// setup code - you'll only need to run this once per app
var schtick = new Schtick();
var redis = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost:6379");
var wrapper = new RedisSchtickWrapper(() => redis.GetDatabase());

// use the wrapper to wrap the callback before passing it to the task
var wrappedCallback = wrapper.Wrap((task, time) => RebuildIndex());
// always use AddAsyncTask() for wrapped callbacks
schtick.AddAsyncTask("rebuild-index", "minute(5)", wrappedCallback);
{% endhighlight %}

The wrapper around the callback will attempt to acquire a Redis lock for that specific task and event time. If it's successful, then the inner callback is called. If it does not acquire the lock, then this means another server has already claimed the task this time.

> If you're curious how this works, take a look at [the source code](https://github.com/schyntax/cs-Schyntax.RedisLock/blob/master/Schyntax.RedisLock/RedisSchtickWrapper.cs). There's not that much to it, and you could easily write your own locking mechanism if your infrastructure doesn't use Redis. But seriously, why are you not using Redis?

There is also a `WrapAsync()` method for wrapping async callbacks:

{% highlight csharp %}
wrapper.WrapAsync(async (task, time) => await DoSomethingAsync());
{% endhighlight %}

#### Time Windows

We've got our schedule running at five minutes past the hour, and multiple servers are supported. Now, for the last item on our wishlist, we want a rule which says, "if the server is down at that time, but comes back up within ten minutes, then run the task right away, otherwise wait until the next scheduled time."

This becomes relatively trivial with the help of `RedisSchtickWrapper.GetLastRunInfo()`:

{% highlight csharp %}
// first, get the last time the task was known to have run
var info = wrapper.GetLastRunInfo("task-name");
// then provide the last scheduled time, along with a time window to AddAsyncTask
schtick.AddAsyncTask("task-name", 
                    "minute(5)",
                    wrapper.Wrap((task, time) => RebuildIndex()),
                    window: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10),
                    lastKnownRun: info.ScheduledTime);
{% endhighlight %}

> If you've never run the task before, `info.ScheduledTime` will be `default(DateTime)` which tells Schtick "I have no information to give you." Therefore, there's no need to special case first-time tasks.

That's it, in those few lines of code, I've solved every single one of my original scheduling concerns. Sadly, when I went back and looked that the body of my `RebuildIndex()` method, I only found this:

{% highlight csharp %}
throw new NotImplementedException();
{% endhighlight %}

So... I'm gonna need another 6-8 weeks.

## Using Schyntax at Stack Overflow

In the marginally less fictional world, we (Stack Overflow) have had a scheduler (not related to Schyntax) for years which runs as a service on a server in our primary data center. It makes http requests to web servers in order to invoke tasks at defined intervals. It works great for most of our applications, including the [Q&A network](http://stackexchange.com/sites), and [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/). However, for my team (Ad Server), we needed something with more precise timing, more flexible scheduling, and something which worked the same on local as it did in production without extra setup.

That's why I built Schyntax/Schtick. We use it for running data synchronizations, re-calculating multipliers for ad campaigns, taking snapshots of metrics, flushing analytics, posting scheduled messages into chat, and more. Some of our tasks run on all servers, and some only run on one at a time - all of which is easy to setup.

As an example of a scheduled task, we flush staged ad analytic data out of Redis and into SQL Server once per minute. The way our Redis memory usage smoothed out after we started using Schtick for that task really illustrates the difference in consistency between Schtick and our old scheduler. All of a sudden, the task which was supposed to flush data out of Redis once per minute was _actually_ running once per minute.

To be clear, the memory spikes weren't actually a problem, they were simply a side-effect of the inconsistency of our old scheduler.

## How to Get It

The C# Schyntax library is available on nuget [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Schyntax.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/nu/Schyntax) and the source code is [on Github](https://github.com/schyntax/cs-schyntax).

There are also JavaScript [Schyntax](https://github.com/schyntax/js-schyntax) and [Schtick](https://github.com/schyntax/js-schtick) libraries with most of the same features, but there are [some syntax differences](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax#csharp-js-differences) between it and the C# version.

Schyntax.RedisLock is available on nuget [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Schyntax.RedisLock.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/nu/Schyntax.RedisLock) with source code [on Github](https://github.com/schyntax/cs-Schyntax.RedisLock). It uses [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) as its Redis connection library. There is currently no JavaScript equivalent.

Depending on interest levels, I would love to port Schyntax to other languages. With a reference implementation, and an [official test suite](https://github.com/schyntax/schyntax/blob/master/tests.json), it shouldn't be too hard. If you're interested in contributing a port, please let me know. There are also features, such as [mixins](https://github.com/schyntax/js-schyntax/issues/3) which may eventually be added to the language.
