I'm a self-taught programmer with a degree in film production. I used to live in Boise, Idaho, and Kansas City, Missouri before that, but now I live in New York City because it's crowded, expensive, and impractical.

    <h2>I work at Stack Overflow</h2>
    <p>
      You know, the site where you get all your programming questions answered (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>). I'm a developer and team-lead on our Ad Server team.

    <h2>I'm a pilot</h2>
    <p>
      I've been a private pilot since December 2012, and, like all pilots, I love talking about and flying airplanes. I spend a fair amount of time on <a href="http://aviation.stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange Aviation</a> where I'm a moderator, and often in chat.

      I did my primary training in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_SR20">Cirrus SR20</a> at <a href="http://skyvector.com/airport/BOI/Boise-Air-Terminal-Gowen-Field-Airport">KBOI</a> in Boise, Idaho, but now I live in New York, NY and fly out of <a href="http://skyvector.com/airport/FRG/Republic-Airport">KFRG</a> on Long Island.

    <h2>Let's play some songs</h2>
    <p>
      I keep guitars in my office, and other music-inclined Stackers (yeah, that's what we call people who work at Stack Overflow) come by and play occasionally. One time I recorded some videos of me playing in my office and put them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7uZX8WcqhM_KjAyX3v9Mw">on youtube</a>. Perhaps I'll do more of that in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biggest thing I miss about living in New York is having a piano in my house, and being able to scream out songs at three in the morning.

I also have a [non-technical blog](http://bretcope.blogspot.com/) where I write about [elevators](http://bretcope.blogspot.com/2014/02/i-have-favorite-elevator.html) and [visiting Russia](http://bretcope.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-night-in-moscow.html).
